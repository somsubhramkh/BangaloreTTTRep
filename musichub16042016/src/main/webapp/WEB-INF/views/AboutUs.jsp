<h4>ABOUT US</h4>
MusicHub is India's largest direct online retailer for musical instruments and pro audio equipment.  We also offer a wide range of services to the music entertainment industry.

The MusicHub brand is well known for our focus on customer service and it has become one of the most trusted names in the industry. MusicHub maintains very healthy tie-ups with India's top performing individual artists, bands and music producers and we vow to deliver the same service to all musicians in India. Our vision is to dominate all aspects of the music industry including music creation, production, education, consumption, artist relations, curation and culture.

MusicHub has worked with many reputable brands including Walt Disney Studio, Sony Music, Vishesh Films, Pepsi MTV Indies, Harman Professional India, and Gibson. In 2012, Music Trades Magazine, USA, ranked MusicHub.com among the world's top 20 music retailers.

Our Entertainment division conceptualised and executed India’s first full-scale two-day heavy metal festival ‘BIG69’ in Mumbai (January 2015), bringing down several international and Indian bands to play across three stages.

In January 2015, Austin Bazaar founder Suman Singh took over as CEO of MusicHub, bringing in his valuable experience in scaling up fast growing companies. Under his watch, MusicHub has grown over 350% in 2015-16. We look forward to continuing our accelerated growth and fulfilling our vision for the company.
